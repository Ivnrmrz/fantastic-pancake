First of all you need to write your IR codes down, to find the codes you can upload "LED_CODE" to your arduino.

while in arduino ide, go to tools > serial monitor, when you push a button on the remote a "serial" will come up, 
copy this number to your notepad as it will be used later on.

After you have all your "serial's" for every button used, open "LED_CODE_2", here you will have to change all the 
0000000's to the numbers corresponding to the remote outputs you wrote down earlier.
